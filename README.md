# Snake Game

### Gameplay
Using the arrow keys to control direction, navigate around the board to collect apples and avoid hitting the borders or your own tail. Eating an apple increases your length by one while hitting the borders or tail will cause the game to end. The goal is to get the longest length snake. The snake game is created using Python and the pygame library.

### How to Run
To play the snake game, you must have the `pygame` library. If you don't have it, it can be installed using `pip install pygame`.

To run the game, navigate to the folder `snake-game` in terminal and run `python snake_game.py`. You can also run `snake_game.py` in any other ways you would run a python file.
